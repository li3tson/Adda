## :rocket: About

`Adda Weather` is a website that aims to transform the way you track the weather. More than just showing weather data for a few countries, Adda Weather offers an immersive and elegant experience for its users.

## :package: Technologies

The main idea of this project was to create an attractive website without using external libs such as axios to make requests or even css preprocessors. So I chose to just use:

- `HTML5`
- `CSS3`
- `JavaScript`

## :flight_departure: Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, simply open the index.html file in any browser or use the vscode live server extension or even if you prefer, you can create a simple local server to run the project.
